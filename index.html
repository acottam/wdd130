        <p>Hey there, I'm Adam—a family guy first, digital adventurer second! Proud dad of two spirited daughters (15 and 12) and an energetic 9-year-old son, you'll often find me exploring the breathtaking trails, hidden sushi spots, and fascinating museums around the Pacific Northwest with my wife and kiddos. While I'm passionate about my day job architecting innovative digital solutions, mentoring teams, and collecting Salesforce badges (like pancakes!), nothing beats family road trips and weekend adventures. Always curious, always learning, and occasionally sneaking dad jokes into daily stand-ups—let's connect and swap adventure stories!</p>
