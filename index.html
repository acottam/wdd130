        <p>Hey there, I'm Adam—a family guy first, digital adventurer second! Proud dad of two spirited daughters (15
            and 12) and an energetic 9-year-old son, you'll often find me exploring the breathtaking trails, hidden
            sushi spots, and fascinating museums around the Pacific Northwest with my wife and kiddos. While I'm
            passionate about my day job architecting innovative digital solutions, mentoring teams, and collecting
            Salesforce badges (like pancakes!), nothing beats family road trips and weekend adventures. Always curious,
            always learning, and occasionally sneaking dad jokes into daily stand-ups—let's connect and swap adventure
            stories!</p>

        <p>Oregon is a stunningly diverse state in the Pacific Northwest, known for its rugged coastline, lush forests, volcanic mountains, and high desert plains. Home to Crater Lake—the deepest lake in the U.S.—and iconic spots like Mount Hood and the Columbia River Gorge, it offers endless opportunities for outdoor adventure. With a culture that blends laid-back charm, local artisans, and a fierce love of the environment, Oregon is as eclectic as it is beautiful.</p>
